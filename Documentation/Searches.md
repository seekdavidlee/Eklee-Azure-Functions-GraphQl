# Searches
We can have the ability to search across multiple types and ochestrate into a common type.

## Search Aggregations
The following shows an example of a search using BeginSearch which lets us add types to search on. One important feature here is the option to BuildWithAggregate which lets us display aggregates. For more information, refer here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-faceted-navigation.

We should apply the IsFacetable to define aggregation on the appropriate property on Search Model and IsFilterable to filter on that property.

```
queryBuilderFactory.Create<MySearchResult2>(this, "searchWithAggregate", "Searches across Models.")
	.WithCache(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
	.WithParameterBuilder()
	.BeginSearch()
		.Add<MySearch3>()
		.BuildWithAggregate()
	.BuildQueryResult(ctx =>
	{
		var searches = ctx.GetSystemItems<SearchResult>();
		var output = new MySearchResult2();

		var idList = new List<string>();
		searches.ForEach(search =>
		{
			idList.AddRange(search.Values.Select(y => ((MySearch3)y.Value).Id));
			output.Aggregates.AddRange(search.Aggregates);
		});

		ctx.Items["Output"] = output;
		ctx.Items["search3IdList"] = idList.Select(id => (object)id).ToList();
	})
	.ThenWithQuery<Model3V2>()
	.WithPropertyFromSource(x => x.Id, ctx => (List<object>)ctx.Items["search3IdList"]).BuildQueryResult(ctx =>
	{
		var results = ctx.GetQueryResults<Model3V2>();
		var output = (MySearchResult2)ctx.Items["Output"];
		output.Results = results.Select(r => new MySearchResult
		{
			DateField = r.DateField,
			DoubleField = r.DoubleField,
			Field = r.Field,
			Id = r.Id,
			IntField = r.IntField
		}).ToList();

		ctx.SetResults(new List<MySearchResult2> { output });
	}).BuildQuery().BuildWithSingleResult();
```

Finally, we will have the ability to show the search aggregates as well as the ability to filter based on the value from search aggregate so that the user can drill down on their search.

```
query {
  searchWithAggregate(searchtext:{equal:"orange"},filters:[
    {
      fieldName:"FieldTwo"
      fieldValue:"katy"
      comparison:notequal
    }
  ]){
    results {
      id
      field
    }
    aggregates {
      fieldName
      fieldAggregates {
        count
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## More on Search Filters
We support the following filtering types: string, double, datetime and int.
